# ASP.NET MVC Stuff

All kinds of ASP.NET MVC codes that can be reused between projects with little or no modification.

This project was initially based on https://github.com/loune/MVCStuff with it's `DefaultDictionaryBinder`.
Since I have changed the project so much since then, I decided to detach it from that repository.
I now plan on making this a real library, with NuGet packages, when possible.
