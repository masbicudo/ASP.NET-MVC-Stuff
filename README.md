# ASP.NET-MVC-Stuff
All kinds of ASP.NET MVC codes that can be reused between projects with little or no modification.

This project was initially based on https://github.com/loune/MVCStuff. Since I have changed it so much since then, I decided to detach it from that repository. I now plan on making this a real library, with NuGet packages, when possible.
